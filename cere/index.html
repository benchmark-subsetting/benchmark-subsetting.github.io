<h1>Codelet Extractor and REplayer</h1>

<h2 id="whatiscere">What is CERE?</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">

Codelet Extractor and REplayer (CERE) is an open source framework for code
isolation. CERE finds and extracts the hotspots of an application as isolated
fragments of code, called codelets.  Codelets can be modified, compiled, run,
and measured independently from the original application. Code isolation
reduces benchmarking cost and allows piecewise optimization of an application.
Unlike previous approaches, CERE isolates codes at the compiler Intermediate
Representation level. Therefore CERE is language agnostic and supports many
input languages such as C, C++, Fortran, and D. CERE automati- cally detects
codelets invocation that have the same performance behavior. Then, it selects a
reduced set of representative codelets and invocations, much faster to replay,
which still captures accurately the origi- nal application. In addition, CERE
supports recompiling and retargeting the extracted codelets. Therefore, CERE
can be used for cross-architecture performance prediction or piecewise code
optimization. On the SPEC 2006 FP benchmarks, CERE codelets cover 90.9% and
accurately replay 66.3% of the execution time.  We use CERE codelets in a
realistic study to evaluate three different architectures on the NAS
benchmarks.  CERE accurately estimates each architecture performance and is
7.3 times to 46.6 times cheaper than running the full benchmark.

    CERE takes as an input the source files of an application or a benchmark
    suite. All the languages supported by the LLVM front-ends (C, C++, Fortran,
    D, etc.) are accepted. The application loops are outlined and instrumented
    with profiling probes to identify the application hotspots. The hot loops
    are kept and form the full codelet set. CERE can prune this full codelet
    set and only keep a reduced set of  representative codelets.  Then, a
    clustering algorithm analyzes the invocation performance trace of each
    codelet to find a representative subset of invocations. The memory and
    cache state of each representative invocation is then captured and dumped
    to disk.  The output of this process is a set of representative codelets
    and invocations, which can be redistributed, recompiled and replayed on
    different systems and architectures. The codelet set can be used as a proxy
    for original application in optimization or benchmarking studies.</p>
