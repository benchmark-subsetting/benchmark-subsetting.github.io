1. Introduction

Here are described the updates between the 2.3 and the 3.0 structured NAS C OpenMP Parallel Benchmark. 
The modifications were performed to match the 3.0 parallel region structure. 

In most of the case, parallel regions were split in smaller pieces. 
Also, due to algorithmic changes, some new parallel regions were introduced. 

We focus to reproduce the main parallel regions. Nevertheless, there
still are some regions to be updated, some pre-computation or post-computation regions.

2. LOG

Each modification is presented with the line number in the 2.3 version and the 3.0 version.

  * Represents changes due to parallel region structure 
  ** Presents other changes such as data type or synchronization modification introduced by the new parallel region structure   

BT
  * Transforms the initialization process into distinct parallel regions:
    129:127 - initialize  
    131:128 - lhsinit
    133:129 - exact_rhs
  * Splits adi function into separated parallel regions:
    211:206 - compute_rhs
    213:209 - x_solve
    215:212 - y_solve
    217:215 - z_solve
    219:218 - add
  ** TODO - Initialization part different 

CG
  * Updates sparse in makea
    761:756 - add preload data pages parallel region loop 
  * Splits the first main parallel region 
    187:195 - initialization parallel region in main are reduced and single regions are replaced by serial parts 
    356:347 - conj grad (see below)
    209:219 - three loops parallelization        
  * Decompose Conj grad function into parallel regions 
    402:395 - initialize conj grad algorithm
    413:405 - conj grad iteration loop
    551:551 - compute residual norm explicitly             
  * Split the second main parallel region
    261:260 - conj grad
    275:271 - post conj grad two loops parallelization
  ** 78:78 - Remove temporarry array w 
  ** 375:367 - Remove static variables in conj grad since they are initialized at each iteration
  ** 500:494 - Add barrier after reduction because LLVM OpenMP does not support implicit synchronization after a reduction
  ** 504:498 - Remove single because all the variables are private due to parallel regions updates
EP
  * Parallelizes x-array initialization
    109:110 - main

FT
  * Splits the first main parallel region   
    123:123 - compute_indexmap
    131:130 - fft (see below)
  * Splits the second main parallel region   
    176:168 - evolve
    164:158 - fft
    187:177 - fft
    845:849 - checksum 
  * Decompose fft into parallel regions
    514:501 - cffts1
    562:556 - cffts2
    607:606 - cffts3    
  ** define y0 and y1 in cffts[123] on the stack because there is no pointer in fortran
  ** TODO - need to insert init_ui to touch the initial data 
IS
  * Already in C

LU
  * Splits into parallel regions boundaries and initialization of dependent variables and also forcing term computing
    125:123 - setbv
    130:128 - setiv

    3068:3087 - rhs
    3064:3083 - SSOR initialization
    3094:3112 - SSOR iteration 
  * TODO - Parallelize post computation part
    - error 
    - pintgr

MG
