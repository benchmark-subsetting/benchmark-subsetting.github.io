The data analysis of the paper _Fine-grained Benchmark Subsetting for System Selection_
is available as a reproducible IPython Notebook.

The notebook can be [visualized](http://benchmark-subsetting.github.io/fgbs/)
or [downloaded](https://github.com/benchmark-subsetting/benchmark-subsetting.github.io/tree/master/fine-grained-subsetting)
so you can regenerate the data analysis on your own computer.
